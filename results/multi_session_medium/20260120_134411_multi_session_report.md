## Summary Matrix: Final Session Pass Rates

This shows the pass rate at the final session for each model × strategy combination.

| Model | none | reflection | episodic |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| haiku | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| sonnet | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |

## Improvement Over Sessions

This shows how each strategy's pass rate changes across sessions.

### HAIKU

| Session | none | reflection | episodic |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| 2 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| 3 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| 4 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| 5 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| **Δ (1→N)** | +0.0% | +0.0% | +0.0% |

### SONNET

| Session | none | reflection | episodic |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |

| 4 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| 5 | 80.0% | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| **Δ (1→N)** | +0.0% | +0.0% | +0.0% |

## Episode Accumulation

Shows how many episodes (learned experiences) accumulated for each strategy.

### HAIKU

| Session | none | reflection | episodic |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
