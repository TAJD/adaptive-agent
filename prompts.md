# Project Planning Notes

## Initial Goals

1. Have a relatively simple agent with a clear API and software design
2. Enable benchmarking of improvements to agent performance
3. Abstract agent self-improvement logic through a clean API
4. Extend testing capabilities for more detailed analysis

## Design Approach

Focus on:
- Clean architecture for self-improvement strategies
- Benchmarking framework for comparing approaches
- Extensible testing infrastructure
- Clear separation between agent logic and improvement mechanisms
